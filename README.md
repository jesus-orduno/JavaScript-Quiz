# JavaScript-Quiz

## Description

In preparation for coding assessments as part of an interview process, and in order to use the skills covered in module four, I have built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This quiz has questions on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that the user can gauge their progress compared to others.

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
